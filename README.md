# CAS_verificator

## API Steps

<ol>
<li>Plan Your API: Determine what functionality your API will provide, what endpoints it will have, what data it will accept and return, etc.
</li><br>

The purpose of the CAS_verificator API is to check if a given CAS number is present on a given CAS number target lists. This would help to solve issues related to safety or export control. The input is either a single CAS number or a list of CAS numbers uploaded (vertically formatted list). The output is another list resuming in which of the lists a given CAS number is matched.

<ul>
<li>Single CAS Number Input: Allow users to input a single CAS number through a text field or parameter. This could be useful for quick checks or ad-hoc verifications.

<li>Uploaded List of CAS Numbers: Provide the option for users to upload a list of CAS numbers. This could be in a vertically aligned format, where each CAS number is on a separate line. This method would be convenient for bulk verification of multiple CAS numbers at once.

<li>For the uploaded list of CAS numbers, file format validation (e.g., CSV or plain text) and error handling for invalid or malformed input files.
</ul>

<!-- Define the Purpose: What problem does your API solve? Clearly articulate the purpose and goals of your API. For example, it might provide access to a database, perform specific calculations, integrate with third-party services, etc.

Identify Endpoints: Determine the endpoints your API will expose. An endpoint is a specific URL where your API can be accessed, and each endpoint typically corresponds to a specific function or resource. For example:

/users - Retrieve a list of users or create a new user.
/products - Retrieve a list of products or add a new product.
/orders - Retrieve a list of orders or create a new order.
Define Request and Response Formats: Decide on the data formats your API will accept in requests and return in responses. Common formats include JSON and XML. Specify the structure of the request payloads and response bodies for each endpoint.

Determine Authentication and Authorization: Decide how clients will authenticate with your API and what level of access they'll have. Will you use API keys, OAuth tokens, or some other mechanism? Additionally, consider what permissions different users or clients will have.

Handle Errors: Plan how your API will handle errors and communicate them to clients. Define standard error formats and HTTP status codes to use for different types of errors.

Consider Security: Think about security measures such as input validation, data sanitization, and protection against common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Versioning: Decide on a versioning strategy for your API. This is important to ensure backward compatibility as you make changes and additions to your API in the future.

Rate Limiting: Determine if you need to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse or excessive usage of your API by individual clients.

Documentation: Plan how you will document your API. Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for developers who will be integrating with your API. Consider using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for generating API documentation.

Testing Strategy: Plan how you will test your API during development. This includes unit testing individual components, integration testing endpoints, and possibly setting up automated testing pipelines. -->

<li>Choose a Technology Stack: Decide what programming language and framework you'll use to build your API. Popular choices include Node.js with Express, Python with Flask or Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.
</li>

<li>Create Your API Code: Write the code for your API endpoints based on your plan. This involves defining routes, handling requests, interacting with databases or other services if needed, and returning appropriate responses.
</li>

<li>Version Control with Git: Initialize a git repository for your project and commit your code. If you're new to Git and GitHub, you can refer to tutorials online or GitHub's own documentation to get started.
</li>

<li>Set Up Continuous Integration (Optional): You might want to set up continuous integration to automatically run tests whenever you push changes to your repository. Services like GitHub Actions or Travis CI can help with this.
</li>

<li>Host Your API on GitHub: You can host your API code on GitHub by pushing your code to a repository. Make sure to follow best practices for structuring your repository and include a README with instructions on how to use your API.
</li>

<li>Document Your API: Write clear documentation for your API endpoints, including details about each endpoint, the parameters it accepts, and the responses it returns. You can use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to help with this.
</li>

<!-- Documentation and Examples: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for developers integrating with your API. Include examples of API requests and responses to help users understand how to use the API effectively. -->

<li>Handle Authentication and Authorization (If Needed): Depending on your API's requirements, you may need to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to your API endpoints.
</li>

<li>Deploy Your API (Optional): While GitHub can host your API code, you may need to deploy it to a server or a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud to make it publicly accessible.
</li>

<li>Test Your API: Before making your API publicly available, thoroughly test it to ensure it behaves as expected and handles various edge cases and error scenarios gracefully.
